# RUBRIC — preview HTML review (10 points; pass ≥ 8)

The preview-html-reviewer subagent scores `light.html` and `dark.html` against the approved `draft.md` (now `services/{slug}.md`). Reviewer reads only — no edits.

## Item 1 — File structure (2 pts, hard requirement)

Both HTML files exist and conform:

- `<html lang="{ko|en}" data-theme="{light|dark}">` — `data-theme` matches the filename (`light.html` → `data-theme="light"`, etc.).
- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/preview/_runtime/tokens.css">` — absolute path, not relative or under `{slug}/_runtime/`.
- `<script src="/preview/_runtime/iframe.js" defer></script>` — required for the parent route to grow the iframe to fit content.
- All page CSS is in a single inline `<style>` block (no external stylesheets beyond tokens.css).
- No external JS frameworks (no React, no jQuery — these are static HTML pages).
- File size < 100KB each.
- If the orchestrator passes `expected_logo_src_path` (or design.md frontmatter includes `logo`), both HTML files must contain a `<img src="{expected_logo_src_path}">` rendered in a visible brand/hero position. The required form is **site-relative** (e.g. `/logos/toss.png`) — NOT the absolute URL (`https://getdesign.kr/logos/toss.png`) that design.md frontmatter stores. Preview HTML lives inside the catalog site's iframe, so site-relative is correct; the absolute URL exists only in frontmatter so that copied design.md files stay meaningful outside the site.

**Pass**: 2 pts if all checks pass. 0 pts if any structural element missing or wrong path. No partial credit.

**Failure modes**: writing `tokens.css` as a relative path; creating a per-slug `_runtime/` folder (the runtime is shared); adding `<script src="https://cdn.../react.js">`; frontmatter says `logo: https://getdesign.kr/logos/toss.png` but light.html or dark.html omits the `<img src="/logos/toss.png">` site-relative form (or worse, embeds the absolute URL itself in `<img src>`).

## Item 2 — Color fidelity (2 pts)

The preview is a **component demo**, not a swatch catalog — the standalone color-swatch grid moved to the token cards (`{slug}.tokens.json`, rendered on the detail page). Color fidelity is therefore checked in **application**: the documented `## Colors` are declared as CSS custom properties (inline `:root` or inherited from tokens.css) and the brand/semantic roles (primary, accent, surface, text, state colors) are visibly applied to components with their exact OKLCH expression — character-for-character, no rounding, no hex/rgb conversion.

**Pass criteria**:
- 2 pts: the documented palette is declared as tokens and the key roles (primary, accent, surface, text) are applied to real components with exact OKLCH values.
- 1 pt: colors applied but one or two roles hardcoded as hex/rgb, or a documented role unused anywhere.
- 0 pts: ≥ 3 roles missing/unused, or values converted to hex/rgba in component styles.

**Failure modes**: rebuilding a color-swatch showcase grid (that catalog belongs in the token cards, not the preview); hardcoding `#E69245` in a button instead of the documented `oklch(0.7 0.18 50)` token.

## Item 3 — Typography hierarchy (2 pts)

No standalone type-scale showcase — the documented scale lives in the token cards. Typography is checked in **application**: the component demo renders text across the documented hierarchy (display/heading, body, caption at minimum) at the documented sizes/weights. Pretendard Variable is applied to body text (inherited from tokens.css `body` rule). Tabular-nums (`font-feature-settings: "tnum"`) used wherever the design.md specifies.

**Display face check**: if the design.md `## Typography` defines a `font-display` distinct from the body face (first family is not Pretendard) together with a `font-display-src`, the preview must (a) load that webfont via a `<link>` in the `<head>` of BOTH files and (b) apply it to the hero headline (`.hero h1`, via `var(--*-font-display)` or the stack). A documented brand display face that renders in Pretendard because the webfont link or stack was omitted is a fidelity miss. When the design.md has only one sans face, this check is N/A (Pretendard from tokens.css is correct).

**Pass criteria**:
- 2 pts: hierarchy visible across components at documented sizes/weights; body in Pretendard Variable and any documented `font-display-src` brand face loaded + applied to the hero headline; sample uses real Korean text for `lang: ko` previews to verify Korean fallback chain.
- 1 pt: hierarchy present but one tier unused or wrong weight.
- 0 pts: single flat text size; system font; English-only sample for a Korean-lang doc.

**Failure modes**: rebuilding a typography-scale showcase section (that belongs in the token cards); using `font-family: -apple-system` somewhere that overrides Pretendard; a design.md `font-display` brand face (e.g. Wanted Sans) that never loads — no `<head>` webfont `<link>`, hero headline left rendering in Pretendard.

## Item 4 — Component coverage (2 pts)

Each component named in `## Components` of the design.md is visibly rendered in the preview, with documented variants and states (hover, active, disabled where applicable).

**Pass criteria**:
- 2 pts: every named component rendered; primary variant + at least one state variation per interactive component.
- 1 pt: most components present but one missing or showing only a default state.
- 0 pts: ≥ 2 named components absent.

**Failure modes**: naming `EtaBanner` and `RiderMapPin` in design.md but only rendering generic buttons; showing buttons but no hover/disabled states.

## Item 5 — Light↔dark distinction (2 pts)

`dark.html` uses brand-appropriate dark variants — not a literal inversion of `light.html`. Specifically:

- Surface colors shift to dark variants chosen to match the brand mood (e.g. a warm brand uses a warm dark, not gray).
- Primary color lightness is adjusted +5–10 (or whatever is needed) for sufficient contrast against the dark surface.
- All component surfaces, text, and accents are updated to dark-mode token values.
- Text remains comfortably legible (WCAG AA contrast at minimum).

**Pass criteria**:
- 2 pts: dark.html shows considered dark adaptation; primary still recognizable but contrast-adjusted; no text below WCAG AA.
- 1 pt: dark.html exists and is distinct, but one or two tokens forgotten in light values, or contrast borderline.
- 0 pts: dark.html is identical to light.html, or just has `body { background: black; color: white }` without per-token thinking.

**Failure modes**: copy-pasting light.html and only flipping `background` and `color`; leaving the primary at its light-mode OKLCH; illegible accent text on dark.

## Mobile overflow (advisory static check — emits `warn` issues, does NOT change the 10-point score)

The reviewer reads CSS only and cannot render at 375px, so this is a STATIC scan of the inline `<style>` block, not a measured check. It adds **no points** — the score stays out of 10 across Items 1–5. Instead, append one `warn` issue per distinct violation so the author fixes it on the next pass. Every horizontal-overflow bug shipped so far reduced to a CSS Grid `1fr` track flooring at `min-content`; scan for these four patterns:

- **Multi-column grid with no mobile collapse.** A `grid-template-columns` declaring 2+ tracks with no `@media (max-width: …)` override reducing the column count. Footer, swatch grid, and hero split are the usual offenders.
- **Bare `1fr` on a content-bearing grid.** `1fr` / `repeat(n, 1fr)` (instead of `minmax(0, 1fr)`) on a track holding wide content (token strings, device mocks). Skip if the same selector also has a mobile rule collapsing it to one column.
- **Flex/grid item with a fixed-width child but no `min-width: 0`.** A container that is itself a grid/flex item and wraps a device/phone mock, an `<img>`, or a `white-space: nowrap` label.
- **Generic class-name collision.** The same single-word class (`.brand`, `.card`, `.item`) used both as a standalone selector and in a compound selector (e.g. `.brand` AND `.swatch.brand`) — the standalone rule's `display`/`white-space`/`gap` leak onto the compound element.

Emit each as e.g. `{"severity":"warn","section":"footer grid","fix":"`.brand-footer` declares 4 columns with no mobile collapse; add a `@media (max-width:720px)` override to 1–2 columns + `min-width:0` on items."}`. These are **non-blocking** (the whole preview review is non-blocking), but compounding — a preview that overflows at 375px reads as broken on the device most catalog users browse from, so surface them even when the 10-point score passes.

`passed = score >= 8`. The skill treats the preview review loop as **non-blocking** — if score < 8 at iteration 3, the skill proceeds to BUILD_OG with a warning rather than asking the user, since visual previews iterate naturally during real use.
